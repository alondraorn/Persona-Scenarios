### Shu Li

- Shu is a first-year undergraduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles. She’s an international student from China Shu first knew the word when she was in middle school, back in China. Back then, she did not know much about the community, yet she knew her sexual orientation has always been different from that of her female girlfriends’. She was extremely self-conscious, and she did not have anyone to tell her secret to. She desperately wants to join a community and find relevant resources. However, in China, there was no such community or information. After coming to UCLA, she attended several club fairs where she got a flyer from OutWrite Magazine, an LGBTQ organization that provides support to students. She is very excited; she decides to try to browse the website after her lecture. Shu wants to find campus resources as well as resources specifically for international groups. 

- She sits in the library and starts browsing using Safari. She goes on to the website and goes directly to the international resources section on the Home bar. Under that section, there are sub-sections like films, music, and news where she finds information about her interest. She reads a few pieces of news and finds that the information is really valuable. Shu then exits the international tab as he wants to find some outside resources. She then returns to the home page by clicking on the “OutWrite” logo and sees “Community” in the home bar. She hovers he mouse over the word, then she sees there are four sub-sections, among which there are off-campus resources and on-campus resources. She clicks on-campus resources which takes her to a separate page. Shu finds a few other organizations listed on the page and their locations, as well as the criteria for join these organizations. Shu feels relieved and happy as she has found ways to connect, get resources and join the LGBTQ community.
